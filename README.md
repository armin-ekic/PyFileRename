--------Python Automatic File Rename--------------

This project was created based on a tutorial found on realpython.com (https://realpython.com/bulk-file-rename-tool-python/)

The goal is to create a GUI using Qt Designer and PyQt, and use PyQt threads to offload the file
renaming process. "pathlib" is used to  manage system paths and file renames, and the GUI state
is maintined/updated with the renaming process.

With the end product, you will be able to select a collection of files using the GUI, along with
an appropriate naming convention, and the script will use the desired naming convention to rename 
all the selected files.
